# Classic Arcade Game - Frogger

# Summery
This is my arcade game project, build for Udacity Frontend Nanodegree project. 

# How to play the game
Choose a player and start the Game. Use left, right, up, and down arrow keys to move in the board. avoid colliding with the enemies (bugs) and reach the water on the top. Their score increases once they reach the top.
When you reach the water, you win the game and the game will start over. If you run into an enemy bug, you will die and the game will start over. THe enemy bugs are running across the screen at random locations and random speeds. Use the arrow keys to move left, right, forward or backward.
